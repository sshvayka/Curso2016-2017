    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Data are in the smart cities domain.</b>
        <p>
          The data we will be using is about the city of San Francisco. <br>
          This data is obtained from the webpage: https://data.sfgov.org/, which is a "hub" <br>
          for all the open data available at the city of San Francisco. <br>
          With all the data that is available, we can assume that this city is indeed <br>
          in the smart cities domain
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data are available as a CSV file</b>
        <p>
          All the data is available in an array of different formats, such as:<br>
          CSV, JSON, XML and RDF.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data have an open license so it can be published</b>
        <p>
        The webpage has a "Terms of Use", which specifies that all the data in it is available<br>
        to use freely.<br>
          Some datasets have an additional license, but almost all of them are open licenses. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities</b>
        <p>
          All the data available is created by third-parties, but is linked to the city of<br>
          San Francisco, so all of it is linked directly to a real-world entity.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Documentation exists for the data (optional)</b>
        <p>
          Because we have the provider of each dataset, we can always seek more information<br>
          outside the https://data.sfgov.org/ webpage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data can come from multiple data sources (optional)</b>
        <p>
          All the data comes from the same webpage, but each one is propvided by different<br>
          publishers.
        </p>
