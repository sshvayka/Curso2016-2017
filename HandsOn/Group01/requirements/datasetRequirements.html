<ul> Dataset Requirements
 		<p style="color:red;">The data contained in the set is related to the smart management of public transportation in a large city<br />
 		The dataset belongs to the Madrid public bike system (BICIMAD)</p>
 		<p>Data is available as a CSV (comma-separated value) file</p>
 		<p>Data has an open license so it can be published online</p>
 		<p>Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities:<br />
 For this application, the dataset allows to find the concrete location (street, district) and specs (size, model) of any given bike </p>
 		<p>Data is updated as 2016:
 	The data must allow the user to find all the bike rental spots in Madrid so he can pick the closest to him. The application must also 
  show performance indicators of the rental service (per year trimester) and a historic of the incidences occured (such as day reported,
  type of anomaly, total number of closed incidences, open indicences, day resolved)</p>
