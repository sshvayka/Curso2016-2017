Assignment 2
================

**Exercise on RDF and RDFS**. Upload the RDF and RDFS files corresponding to the exercise in the GitHub repository, and comment on those from your colleagues, creating issues in the GitHub repository. This can be done in the Assignment2 folder, **using your GitHub username** + .rdf and .rdfs, or any other similar file extension.

For example, I (my Github username is 'nandana') will upload three files : 
* nandna.png (the image, Exercise 1.a)
* nandana.rdf (Exercise 1.b in RDF/XML), and 
* nandana.ttl (Exercise 1.b in Turtle).
